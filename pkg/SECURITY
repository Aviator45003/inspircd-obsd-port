        The call to strcpy is safe in the context because it copies a statically
        formatted string to the memory location.  To fix it would also involve
        introducing a magic number.

Fixed a bunch of calls to sprintf().
        Some were okay. Fixed them anyway.


There are a bunch of build warnings, ignored, that all include the below:
        In file included from /usr/include/g++/iosfwd:45,

There are calls to system() to generate keys, and one from a perl script to kill
a process. Fortunately, they are called with static strings, and from
non-elevated permissions.

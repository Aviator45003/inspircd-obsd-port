	The call to strcpy is safe in the context because it copies
	a statically formatted string to the memory location.
	To fix it would also involve introducing a magic number.

Fixed a bunch of calls to sprintf().
	Some were okay. Fixed them anyway.


There were a bunch of build warnings that all included the below.
In file included from /usr/include/g++/iosfwd:45,
                 from /usr/include/g++/bits/stl_algobase.h:70,
                 from /usr/include/g++/algorithm:65,
                 from include/inspircd.h:53,
/usr/include/g++/amd64-unknown-openbsd5.6/bits/c++locale.h: In function 'int std::__convert_from_v(int* const&, char*, int, const char*, ...)':
/usr/include/g++/amd64-unknown-openbsd5.6/bits/c++locale.h:81: warning: function might be possible candidate for 'printf' format attribute

There is also a file specific line which changes depending on where 
inspircd.h was included.
These warnings were ignored.
